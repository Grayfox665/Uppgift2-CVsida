This is the second school project.

This was made on Visual Studio Code with HTML and CSS coding

This is a simple site of my CV with several pages having my contacts and about me, there's on the homepage several projekts, the first projekt being the simple login-page i made. 
The other project cards are simple placeholder for future project to be placed in.

Haven't put much info about me, but that will change later in time. For now there is lorem ipsum to act as placeholder.
